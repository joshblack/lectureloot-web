## LectureLoot Web Application

The LectureLoot app is composed of three main components: a front-end mobile (multiple platforms) application, a web-based interface for data analysis, and a comprehensive back-end. The objective is to excite students and provide incentives for them to attend class. Using a wagering system, students will wager points against themselves that they will go to all their classes for the current session, specified by the app, and have the opportunity to win points back, win rewards, or lose points for not attending class.
